# Bare

High-contrast monochrome themes meant to either be used with an e-ink display or
to resemble e-ink on a conventional display. Dark variants are provided if one
wants a similar scheme at night on a conventional display.

For syntax, only strings and comments are differentiated.

This has not yet been tested on an actual e-ink display!
